Souten Kouro,"Souten Kouro's story is based loosely on the events taking place in Three Kingdoms period of China during the life of the last Chancellor of the Eastern Han Dynasty, Cao Cao (155 – March 15, 220), who also serves as the main character.  The Three Kingdoms period has been a popular theme in Japanese manga for decades, but Souten Kouro differs greatly from most of the others on several points. One significant difference is its highly positive portrayal of its main character, Cao Cao, who is traditionally the antagonist in not only Japanese manga, but also most novel versions of the Three Kingdoms period, including the original 14th century version, Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. Another significant difference from others is that the storyline primarily uses the original historical account of the era, Records of Three Kingdoms by Chen Shou, as a reference rather than the aforementioned Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel. By this, the traditional hero of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Liu Bei, takes on relatively less importance within the story and is portrayed in a less positive light. Yet, several aspects of the story are in fact based on the novel version, including the employment of its original characters such as Diao Chan, as well as anachronistic weapons such as Guan Yu's Green Dragon Crescent Blade and Zhang Fei's Viper Blade.  A consistent theme throughout the story is Cao Cao's perpetual desire to break China and its people away from its old systems and ways of thinking and initiate a focus on pragmatism over empty ideals. This often puts him at odds with the prevalent customs and notions of Confucianism and those that support them.  (Source: Wikipedia)","('Action', 'Adventure', 'Historical')",2008

I can't help it! It's impossible for me! I'm sorry."" With these words, the mother left Takashi there and went away. Left alone, Takashi was crying. There he met other children who were in the same situation. ""The Land of Beast"" was the name of this place and some men were taking care of tens of children. The environment seemed not rich, but children seemed to have happy lives. The men were called ""TEN"", looking rather scary, but when speaking, they were all full of heart in spite of the blunt words. One day a nice couple visited this place and took Ken (the cutest) to their home. They seemed to have no children and promised to make him happy. Every one envied him. A gorgeous car arrived. Yet it had the face of the ""SHINDU"" which by force would take away the children. They were called ""SARAIYA"" among the children. Children ran away all at once, but Takashi couldn't make it and was caught and taken into the car. The other children and ""TEN"" prayed, saying ""This can't be helped."" The car went through a big gate and arrived at the place called ""JAIL"". He asked the ""MIHARI"" who would patrol, why he should be treated like this, and a cold answer came back. ""You will be executed in three days."" Three days later, judged by the guards, Takashi was executed. The fact is that in the pet world this happens as a matter of fact, while this is a forcible and absurd procedure in man’s world. The story was replaced in the Buddha's world.
